## **About The Project**

This project is a classic beginner exercise designed to solidify understanding of core web technologies. The goal was to create a functional counter that not only increments and decrements but also includes modern features like persistence, demonstrating a complete, albeit simple, application lifecycle.

## **Features**

* üî¢ **Increment:** Increases the count by one.
* ‚ûñ **Decrement:** Decreases the count by one.
* üîÑ **Reset:** Sets the count back to the initial value of zero.
* üíæ **Persistence:** The current count is automatically saved to the browser's `localStorage`, so the value is remembered even after refreshing or closing the page.

## **What I Learned**

Building this project was a great learning experience. Here are some of the key concepts I practiced:

* **DOM Manipulation:** Selecting and modifying HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
* **Event Handling:** Capturing user interactions like button clicks and running functions in response.
* **State Management:** Managing the `count` variable as the central piece of application "state".
* **Browser Storage:** Using the `localStorage` API to persist data across browser sessions, providing a better user experience.
